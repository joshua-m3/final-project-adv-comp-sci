    <h2>Introduction to the guitar:</h1>
    <p>The guitar comes in many forms, but primarily it is a 6 stringed instrument with anywhere from 18-24 frets (the metal bars separating the rectangles). 
        These frets represent moving up or down the musical alphabet which is comprised of 8 notes with a sharp/flat in between each (except between B & C and E & F).
         This intrument is played through strumming or plucking, by hand or with a pic, while holding down the frets to create musical sound. 
         There are many different types of guitar which include the acoustic or classical, a hollow body wooden guitar, or the electric, a solid body guitar played through an amplifier. 
         Each guitar has immortalized itself in the industry and music history</p>
