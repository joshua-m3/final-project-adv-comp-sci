    <h2>Introduction to the bass guitar:</h1>
    <p>The bass guitar is very similar to a normal guitar with a few key differences. Primarily, it is a 4 stringed instrument with anywhere from 20-24 frets (the metal bars separating the rectangles). 
        These frets represent moving up or down the musical alphabet which is comprised of 8 notes with a sharp/flat in between each (except between B & C and E & F).
         This intrument is played by finger plucking the strigs while holding down the frets to create musical sound. A bass guitar is characterized by its low sound, as it is tuned a full octave down from a guitar (an octive is 8 musical notes). This makes it useful for rhythm and low end sound.
         There are many different types of bass guitars as well, which include the acoustic, a hollow body wooden bass guitar, the electric, a solid body bass guitar played through an amplifier, or an upright bass, a large hollow body wooden bass played standing up.
         Each guitar has immortalized itself in the industry and music history</p>

    <h2>Personal Experience:</h2>
    <p>I have been playing bass guitar for the last two years, and actually prefer it over normal guitars. The bass is incredibly fun, rewarding, and less stressful, as basslines are mean't to fill in the background and groove of a song. Combined with the fewer strings, it is generally easier to play and makes the bass enjoyable and calming.</p>
